# GitHub One Click Comment

GitHub One Click Comment is a Chrome extension that allows you to make a list of predefined comments and adds them to the GitHub UI on Pull Requests and Issues as new buttons.

If you add predefined comments while on a PR, you must refresh the page to see the buttons, currently.
