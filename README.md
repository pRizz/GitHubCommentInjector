# GitHub Comment Injector

GitHub Comment Injector is a Chrome extension that allows you to make a list of predefined comments and adds them to the GitHub UI on Pull Requests as new buttons (may add support for adding comments to Issues page later).

If you add predefined comments while on a PR, you must refresh the page to see the buttons, currently.
